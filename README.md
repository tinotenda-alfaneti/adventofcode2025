# Advent of Code (Rust)

Welcome to my Advent of Code playground — a tiny, slightly nerdy, learning-focused Rust project.

This repo is where I'm practicing Rust by solving Advent of Code puzzles. I built it as a hands-on way to learn the language, rustacean-style (with safety, speed, and a little whimsy). The code here is intentionally simple and incremental: experiments, notes, and small wins live side-by-side.

## Why this project (aka: learning goals)
- Get comfy with Rust's ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
- Practice reading files and parsing text idiomatically.
- Organize code into small, testable modules.
- Learn how to use `cargo run`, `cargo test`, and `cargo fmt`.
- Grow an intuition for iterator combinators and pattern matching.

## A tiny, whimsical license
Do whatever you like with this code. If it helps you learn, it's already done its job.

Happy hacking, and may your borrow checker be generous!
